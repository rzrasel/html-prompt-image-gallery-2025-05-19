Image Prompt

Hyperrealistic military tank (T-90), front view, modern design with intricate armor plating. Camouflage pattern in light beige and olive green. Sharp focus, high resolution, detailed textures, and realistic lighting. Studio shot on a clean, light gray background with no shadows. Heavy machinery and weaponry featured, including detailed treads and gun barrel. Depict dynamic motion in the following variations:

Tank leaping upward from the ground in a powerful jump — dynamic mid-air action, treads extended.

Tank dropping rapidly from the sky toward the ground — dramatic fall, gravity in action, powerful descent.

Tank in mid-jump — suspended in motion, aggressive posture, action-oriented framing.

Image Prompt

Hyperrealistic T-90 military tank in a studio shot, front view with a clean light gray background (no shadows). Features a modern design with intricate armor plating, detailed gun barrel, and realistic treads. Camouflage pattern in light beige and olive green. High resolution, sharp focus, and realistic lighting showcasing detailed textures and meticulous mechanical components. Heavy machinery and weaponry fully visible. Depict dynamic motion scenes including:

Tank launching into the air — jumping powerfully from the ground, treads stretched, ground debris flying, body angled upward.

Tank falling to the ground — mid-air descent, downward momentum, subtle tilt in body showing weight and gravity.

Tank in mid-jump — suspended dynamically, treads flexed, body angled, aggressive forward motion.

Dynamic body angles — varying the tank's posture to show action, impact, and movement in each scene.

Ensure all shots emphasize sharp mechanical realism, motion dynamics, and a clean, distraction-free background.
