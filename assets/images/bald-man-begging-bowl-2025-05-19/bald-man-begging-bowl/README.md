Image Prompt

A middle-aged, bald man, with a light tan complexion, and a vertical white mark on his forehead. He is shirtless, with a light beige or cream-colored cloth wrapped around his waist. A simple, dark brown, shallow bowl is held in his outstretched hand, palms up, as if begging. A light brown or bronze colored chain-like necklace is draped over his upper chest. The setting is a semi-outdoor location, possibly a temple or religious area, with a soft-focus, warm-toned background of tan, beige and dark brown/black. The image has a slightly impressionistic, yet somewhat realistic quality depicting soft light and shadow. Focus is on the man's face and posture, with slightly blurred elements around the background. Warm earthy tones, like terracotta and ochre, dominate the color palette in the foreground, transitioning to deeper browns and blacks in the background. Detailed skin texture, visible wrinkles and lines, and the bowl are key elements.
